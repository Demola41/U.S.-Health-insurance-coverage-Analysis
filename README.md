<a href="https://github.com/Demola41/U.S.-Health-insurance-coverage-Analysis/blob/main/Health%20Insurance%20Coverage%20Dashboard.png">[Dashboard Preview]</a>
## 1. Situation
Analyzed healthcare data across **51 US states** to evaluate the impact of the **Affordable Care Act (ACA)** on insurance coverage rates.
## 2. Task
The objective was to quantify the decline in uninsured rates, assess the correlation between **Medicaid expansion** and coverage growth, and identify the top-performing states to understand policy effectiveness.
## 3. Action
Designed an **Excel Dashboard** to track pre- and post-ACA metrics.
* **Advanced Visualization:** Used Pivot Charts to visualize the "Average Uninsured Rate Change" (**5.43%**) over time.
* **Interactivity:** Implemented Slicers to filter performance by state and Medicaid expansion status.
## 4. Results & Insights
* **Total Impact:** The analysis confirmed a total coverage increase of **19.5M individuals** nationwide.
* **Top Rate Performer:** **Nevada** recorded the highest percentage decline in uninsured rates (**10.30%**).
* **Top Volume Performer:** **California** led in total volume with **3.8M newly insured people**.
## 5. Recommendation
* **Policy Validation:** The analysis validated that states expanding Medicaid saw significantly faster drops in uninsured rates.
* **Benchmarking:** Utilize the **Nevada and California** models as benchmarks for other states looking to maximize ACA tax credit utilization.
